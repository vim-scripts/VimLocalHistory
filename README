VLH automatically saves buffers on write using git.  This provides a convenient, automatic backup system of, e.g. files in /etc that are modified, as well as a poor man's "local history" (a l√° the eclipse feature with the same name).

Feedback, bug reports and suggestions gratefully accepted at <vlh@hjdivad.com>.


To use, install, configure g:vlh_repository_dir and then use vim normally.  Every time you write a buffer whose path is on the local filesystem, a copy is saved in a git repository.

You can open, diff or restore older versions of files with the commands VLHOpen, VLHDiff and VLHReplace.
